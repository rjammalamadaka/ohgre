This is necessary for our third party service providers to provide retargeting services. The collection of this anonymous data allows us to better target our advertising to your interests. The data also helps us and our third party service providers improve our respective product and services.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However\, setting your browser to reject cookies may\, in certain instances\, prevent you from taking full advantage of the System (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities\, or cause some features of the System to function improperly or more slowly.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>The Websites (and certain other portions of the System) use Google Analytics (including the Universal Analytics feature)\, a web analysis service provided by Google\, in order to better understand your use of our Websites (or other portions of the System) and how we can improve the Websites and the System. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a Website\, what pages they visit when they do so\, and what other websites they used prior to coming to such Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Websites\, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Website\, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google&amp;#39;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Websites or the System is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the System\, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the System to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the System\, please review &amp;quot;How Google uses data when you use our partners&amp;#39; sites or apps&amp;quot;\, (located here or any successor URL).

We may also share your information with any of our affiliates\, trusted business partners and third party service providers for the purpose of providing the System\, for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use\, or for any other lawful purposes. When you submit a payment using the System\, we may use third party payment processors to collect and process the Collected Information that is necessary to process your payment on our behalf\, such as credit card information and billing address.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>We may\, from time to time\, utilize a number of trusted business and marketing partners in delivering the content\, materials\, and opportunities available on or through the System. For example\, we may provide your Collected Information to an affiliate or third party provider to re-target certain advertising to you on different portions of the System\, for market or user modeling\, or use in direct advertising through the System or via direct mailing. To the extent necessary for purposes of communicating with you or fulfilling your requests for such content\, materials\, and opportunities\, we may share Collected Information with our affiliates\, third party service providers or business partners. We\, or our respective trusted business parties and third party services providers may also produce reports on the System&amp;#39;s traffic or usage patterns and share these reports with us\, or our business partners and others\, but the information contained in these reports is anonymous and does not allow identification of any specific individual. SouthStar also may release Collected Information in connection with joint marketing efforts and strategic alliances. We do not sell\, rent\, or lease our user lists or the identity of individual users to third parties. However\, SouthStar may use and disclose certain aggregated\, anonymized information\, such as System usage data\, to our affiliates\, third party service providers or trusted business partners.

In an effort to protect the security of our critical infrastructure\, any use of a Website or information relating to such use may be monitored and disclosed to federal authorities or agencies.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>As SouthStar grows and develops its business\, it is possible that its corporate structure or organization might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with\, or that it or portions of its business might be acquired by\, another company. In any such transactions\, customer information generally is\, and should be expected to be\, one of the transferred business assets.&lt;/p>\\n&quot;\,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;},{&quot;termstitle&quot;:&quot;What Information Do We Collect for Sweepstakes\, Promotions\, Contests &amp; Surveys??&quot;\,&quot;termsdescription&quot;:&quot;&lt;p>On the System\, you may wish to participate in online polls\, surveys\, contests\, sweepstakes and other promotions that we may offer from time to time.

Please take care to share only such information as is needed or that you believe is appropriate. Note\, however\, that if you don&amp;#39;t provide certain requested information\, it may prevent us from providing certain Services to you and could also prevent you from taking full advantage of the System (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities\, or cause some features of the System to function improperly. Any promotional email we send to you will contain a link which will allow you to opt out of receiving any further correspondence.
