Compare rates snd plan options&amp;nbsp;with Grand Rapids Energy®.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It’s that simple. Michigan&amp;#39;s Natural Gas Choice program gives customers the choice to purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their traditional utility company. Grand Rapids Energy® is an MPSC-certified natural gas supplier that you may select for your natural gas needs in Michigan. Would you like price stability? GRE offers various fixed plans to meet your needs. Should you choose GRE as your natural gas supplier\, your local utility company in all cases will still maintain distribution channels that deliver gas to your home.&lt;br>\\n&lt;/p>\\n&quot;\,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;termstitle&quot;:&quot;Who is Grand Rapids Energy? &quot;\,&quot;termsdescription&quot;:&quot;&lt;p>Grand Rapids Energy is a part of the SouthStar Energy Services® family\, a preeminent retail natural gas marketing company certified in eight states.
