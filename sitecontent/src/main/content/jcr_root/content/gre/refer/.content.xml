Referrers must also have either an active account or pending active account with GRE on the date the applicable Referee begins active natural gas service with GRE. Existing GRE customers cannot refer themselves. Referrers may combine this offer with their pre-existing discounts and promotions. Referees are not required to provide or enter a unique Referral Code to earn the applicable then-current RAF Program promotion.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If GRE has an active RAF Program promotion for Referees at the time of a Referee enrollment, Referees shall earn the then-current RAF Program promotion by: (i) enrolling on an eligible GRE price plan, (ii) providing or entering the RAF Program promotion code at the time of enrollment (the Referee also has the option to provide or enter the Referrer’s unique Referral Code at that time), and (iii) reaching 60 days of continuous active service with GRE on such eligible price plan.

Only enrollments placed that include the Referrer’s unique Referral Code are eligible for a reward under the RAF Program. Referrers shall participate by sharing their unique Referral Code and enrollment instructions as specified on the Site and in accordance with these terms. If Referrer uses email, Facebook or Twitter communication methods, Referrer shall use the formats provided for these communication methods through the Site (the &amp;quot;Approved Sharing Methods&amp;quot;). Referrers can access the Approved Sharing Methods by going to the RAF Site at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/gre/refer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>grandrapidsenergy.com/refer-a-friend&lt;/a> and authenticating the Referrer’s GRE account.

Referrers will not receive a Visa Reward Card if a referral is rejected or not received for any reason, including if the Referee or Referrer does not satisfy the requirements in these terms. Referrers should not send referrals to people the Referrer does not personally know and Referrers shall honor requests to stop referrals or communications about the Program. Failure to adhere to these guidelines by the Referrer is a violation of these terms and GRE may terminate the Referrer immediately from the RAF Program, disqualify the Referrer from participating in the RAF Program in the future, and cause the forfeiture of any pending Reward Cards.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Referees may only submit one Referral Code when enrolling.
