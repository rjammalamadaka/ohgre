                description="&lt;p>These terms and conditions (&amp;quot;terms&amp;quot;) apply to the Grand Rapids Energy℠(&amp;quot;GRE&amp;quot;) Refer-a-Friend program (&amp;quot;RAF Program&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;). Referrers must click &amp;quot;Agree&amp;quot; to the RAF Program terms to participate in the RAF Program. Referees agree to the RAF Program terms by using an RAF Program promotion code when enrolling with GRE.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Rewards and Eligibility:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Under the Program, (i) qualified new residential or commercial customers who enroll on an eligible GRE price plan (each, a &amp;quot;Referee&amp;quot;) may be eligible to receive a reward under the RAF Program if GRE has an active RAF Program promotion for Referees at the time of Referee’s enrollment and the Referee enrolls using the RAF Program promotion code (each, a &amp;quot;RAF Referee&amp;quot;); and (ii) existing customers with either an active account or pending active account who refer one or more Referees to GRE pursuant to the terms of the RAF Program (each, a &amp;quot;Referrer&amp;quot;) are eligible to receive a reward under the RAF Program.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Referrers shall earn a Visa® Reward Card in an amount stated in the then-current RAF Program promotion for each Referee who: (i) enrolls on an eligible GRE price plan, (ii) provides or enters the Referrer’s unique Referral Code at the time of enrollment, and (iii) ) begins burning gas on an eligible GRE price plan. Referrers must also have either an active account or pending active account with GRE on the date the applicable Referee begins active natural gas service with GRE. Existing GRE customers cannot refer themselves. Referrers may combine this offer with their pre-existing discounts and promotions. Referees are not required to provide or enter a unique Referral Code to earn the applicable then-current RAF Program promotion.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If GRE has an active RAF Program promotion for Referees at the time of a Referee enrollment, Referees shall earn the then-current RAF Program promotion by: (i) enrolling on an eligible GRE price plan, (ii) providing or entering the RAF Program promotion code at the time of enrollment (the Referee also has the option to provide or enter the Referrer’s unique Referral Code at that time), and (iii) reaching 60 days of continuous active service with GRE on such eligible price plan. RAF Referees cannot combine this offer with any other offer. Referees may still provide or enter a Referrer’s unique Referral Code at the time of enrollment while (i) there is no active RAF Program promotion for Referees at the time of the Referee enrollment or (ii) enrolling using another GRE promotional offer. A Referee’s Referrer will not receive a Visa Reward Card unless the Referee provides or enters their Referrer’s unique Referral Code at the time of the Referee’s enrollment.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Program Enrollment; Referral Code:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>To enroll in the Program, the Referrer must authenticate the Referrer’s account and click &amp;quot;Agree&amp;quot; to the Program terms through the Program website currently located at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlyong.com/refer&quot;>grandrapidsenergy.com/refer&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(the &amp;quot;Site&amp;quot;), GRE will then issue a unique Referral Code to the Referrer to track referrals and activations. Only enrollments placed that include the Referrer’s unique Referral Code are eligible for a reward under the RAF Program. Referrers shall participate by sharing their unique Referral Code and enrollment instructions as specified on the Site and in accordance with these terms. If Referrer uses email, Facebook or Twitter communication methods, Referrer shall use the formats provided for these communication methods through the Site (the &amp;quot;Approved Sharing Methods&amp;quot;). Referrers can access the Approved Sharing Methods by going to the RAF Site at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlyong.com/refer&quot;>grandrapidsenergy.com/refer&lt;/a>, clicking &amp;quot;Get Started,&amp;quot; and authenticating the Referrer’s GRE account. Referral emails will not be sent to recipients who have opted out of commercial emails from GRE and no rewards under the RAF Program shall be awarded with respect to any such referrals. Referrer shall comply with any applicable social media rules, guidelines, and terms and conditions in his or her participation in the RAF Program. WHENEVER A REFERRER DECIDES TO SHARE HIS OR HER UNIQUE REFERRAL CODE AND ENROLLMENT INSTRUCTIONS, THE REFERRER MUST NOTIFY THE RECIPIENT THAT THE REFERRER IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A REWARD CARD IF THE RECIPIENT ENROLLS AND MEETS THE RAF PROGRAM CRITERIA. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL REFERRER USE TEXT MESSAGES OR AUTOMATED PHONE MESSAGES TO SHARE THE REFERRAL CODE OR OTHERWISE PROMOTE THE PROGRAM. WHEN SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THE RAF PROGRAM, REFERRERS SHALL NOT MAKE DECEPTIVE OR MISLEADING CLAIMS, MAKE ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT CLAIMS THAT ALTER THE GRE PROMOTION, OR ENGAGE IN ANNOYING OR HARASSING PRACTICES. Referrers will not receive a Visa Reward Card if a referral is rejected or not received for any reason, including if the Referee or Referrer does not satisfy the requirements in these terms. Referrers should not send referrals to people the Referrer does not personally know and Referrers shall honor requests to stop referrals or communications about the Program. Failure to adhere to these guidelines by the Referrer is a violation of these terms and GRE may terminate the Referrer immediately from the RAF Program, disqualify the Referrer from participating in the RAF Program in the future, and cause the forfeiture of any pending Reward Cards.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Referees may only submit one Referral Code when enrolling. Referees may enroll on an eligible price plan either through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlyong.com/&quot;>grandrapidsenergy.com&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or by calling&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tel:1.888.466.4427/&quot; target=&quot;Target&quot;>1.888.466.4427&lt;/a>; some plans may not be eligible.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Card and Promotional Fulfillment:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Any Visa Reward Cards earned by the Referrer will not be issued until the applicable Referee begins active natural gas service with GRE on an eligible price plan. Reward Cards will be delivered to qualified Referrers within 4-6 weeks after such date. Referrers may track their Reward Card(s) by going to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlyong.com/refer&quot;>grandrapidsenergy.com/refer&lt;/a>, clicking &amp;quot;VIEW MY REWARDS,&amp;quot; and following the prompts.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Any Visa Reward Cards or other promotional benefits earned by the Referee will not be issued until the applicable Referee has reached 60 days of continuous active service with GRE on an eligible price plan; (ii) the Referee will not earn the RAF Program promotion available at the time of enrollment if service is terminated for any reason prior to a Referee reaching 60 days of continuous active service with GRE; and (iii) if applicable, Reward Cards will be delivered within 4-6 weeks after the date the card is earned. Other terms and conditions may apply to the RAF Program promotion for Referees, as further detailed in the applicable promotional offer from GRE with the applicable RAF Program promotion code, which terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by reference.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Limits:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>THE MAXIMUM AWARD UNDER THE RAF PROGRAM IS $500 IN VISA REWARD CARDS PER PERSON PER CALENDAR YEAR, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY GRE IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF NEW CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY REFERRED AND/OR DATE OF REFERRAL. ANY VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE $500 LIMIT SHALL NOT CARRY OVER TO SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THIS $500 LIMIT APPLIES TO THE TOTAL OF ALL GRE PROMOTIONAL OFFERS RECEIVED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THIS RAF PROGRAM.
