			<h4>Would you choose a $10 car wash when you could get the EXACT same car wash for $5? 
</h4>
			<p>So why choose a higher rate for natural gas when you could get the same natural gas at a <strong>lower rate?</strong></p>
			<p>Luckily for you, this is possible because in Ohio you can choose your natural gas supplier!</p>
			<p><strong>Huh? What does that mean exactly?</strong><br>
			It means you can purchase natural gas from a company (hint hint, Ohio Natural Gas) who may be offering a lower price than your current utility. Compare rates with Ohio Natural Gas and go with the lowest to save big on your natural gas bill!</p>
			<p><strong>Why is ONG so great?</strong><br>We offer flexible plan options, exceptional customer service and outstanding perks. 
			</p>
			<p>Plus, when you lock in your natural gas price for the next 6 or 12 months with ONG you can avoid price spikes and fluctuations. You don’t have this option with your regulated utility company, but you do with us! And there are no sign-up fees.</p>
			<p><strong>Is switching to ONG difficult?</strong><br>Not a bit. We handle all the details with NO interruption to your service. Switch in just 3 easy steps.</p>
